AstroDX (Formerly named MaipadDX), is a mobile maimai simulator that builds on top of the traditional arcade experience and brings optimizations for mobile devices.

# Project open-source status

Since AstroDX isn't published to any app stores, we wanted to make sure it's hard to be recompiled and sold unofficially (this game is free after all).
However, If you have issues, please don't hesitate to point it out in issues and we'll try to answer them as best as we can.

# Q&A

Q. Which version should I download?

> As of now, v1.1.1 is the latest stable version. You should use this if you prefer having less bugs.  
> If you want more optimizations, a better navigation experience and reworked features (though unstable), you might want to give v2.0 a shot!

**v2.0** is currently undergoing many changes, including a massive UI overhaul, runtime optimizations, vfx / audio system reworks, just to name a few.
However, new features are unstable and will eventually be updated as time progresses. If you live on cutting-edge technology, this is the version for you.

## Are there any tutorials on importing?

Yep, they should be on the [wiki](https://github.com/2394425147/maipaddx/wiki/Importing-levels) of this repo. 

## Can I use charts transcribed from the official arcade game maimai?

We **don't recommend** doing this, as it violates SEGA's policies.

Happy playing!
