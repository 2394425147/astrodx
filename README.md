# AstroDX

AstroDX (Formerly named MaipadDX), is a mobile maimai simulator that builds on top of the traditional arcade experience and brings optimizations for mobile devices.

## Project open-source status

To ensure safety, we're not planning on making the project open-source. This repository serves solely as a knowledgebase for the game.
However, If you have issues, please don't hesitate to point it out in issues and we'll try to answer them as best as we can.

## Which version should I download?

### 1.x

As of now, **v1.1** is the latest stable release of AstroDX. 
Use this version if you want a bug-less experience.

### 2.x

> You should always update to the latest version whenever possible.
> 2.x is constantly updated and it's hard to manage multiple versions of the game algorithms at the same time,
> so we suggest you to keep up-to-date.

**v2.0** is currently undergoing many changes, including a massive UI overhaul, runtime optimizations, vfx / audio system reworks, just to name a few.
However, new features are unstable and will eventually be updated as time progresses. If you live on cutting-edge technology, this is the version for you.
