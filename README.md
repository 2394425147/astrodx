AstroDX (Formerly MaipadDX) is a mobile maimai simulator intended for those who do not yet have access to a cabinet, those who want to practice, and everyone interested in maimai who otherwise could not play the arcade game.  
This game is a clean-room implementation of maimai, and has been developed without using any use of original arcade data.

# Open-source projects

- Simai serializer/deserializer: [SimaiSharp](https://github.com/reflektone-games/SimaiSharp)
- Gameplay logic: [AstroDX core-dump](https://github.com/2394425147/maipaddx/tree/main/core-dump)

We intended to open-source AstroDX after publishing to the iOS/Android app stores. Paid assets will be excluded to comply with licenses.
