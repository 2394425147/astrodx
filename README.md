AstroDX (Formerly named MaipadDX), is a mobile maimai simulator intended for those who don't yet have access to a cabinet, those who want to practice, and everyone interested in maimai.

# Open-source status

We initially intended for AstroDX to be fully open-source after it's uploaded to official app stores, but as the game contains paid assets, we might be only able to partially open-source AstroDX.

However, If you have issues, please don't hesitate to point it out in issues and we'll try to answer them as best as we can.

# Q&A

## Which version should I download?

![GitHub release (latest by date including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/2394425147/maipaddx?include_prereleases)  
v2.0 is the latest version cycle, with full support for festival features, and a superset of simai3 syntaxes (deserialized via [SimaiSharp](https://github.com/reflektone-games/SimaiSharp)).  
v2.0 also includes optimizations, better interfaces, and more customizations. However, it's still in its pre-beta cycle, which means features aren't fully settled, and is prone to changes.

![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/2394425147/maipaddx?label=stable)  
If you prefer a stable build instead, v1.1.1 is the **latest stable version**. You should use this if you prefer a long-term support experience.

## Wait, is there version for iOS?
Yes (kind of)! You can join the test at [TestFlight Group A](https://testflight.apple.com/join/rACTLjPL) or [TestFlight Group B](https://testflight.apple.com/join/ocj3yptn).

Due to restriction of Apple, developer must be 18 (or 19 depends on local law) to publish Applications on App Store. Currently, we borrow JiNALE TEAM's developer account for bringing TestFlight up.

Each public link only can hold 10k players (count by Apple ID), so please NOT duplicate join the test if you already have AstroDX installed.

## Are there any tutorials on importing?

Yep, they should be on the [wiki](https://github.com/2394425147/maipaddx/wiki/Importing-levels) of this repo.

## Can I use charts transcribed from the official arcade game maimai?

We **don't recommend** doing this, as it violates SEGA's policies.

## I'm having some issues...

You can open an issue [here](https://github.com/2394425147/maipaddx/issues).
